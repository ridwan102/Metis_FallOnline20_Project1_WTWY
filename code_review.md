## Clean Code:

- Code follows PEP-8
- Very readable and easy to follow
- Great job using python functions & including docstrings! Love the efficient function to collect and clean data and create dataframe all in one. In future projects these can be moved to separate .py modules and imported.

## Good Documentation:

- Good & informative README.md
- Markdown cell at beginning of .ipynb explains scope and analyis
- Inline code comments were used sparingly, and only included when helpful and necessary
- Could use more markdown cells throughout as section headings and explaining decisions made

## Proper Data Science:

- Nice use of masks for filtering
- Code demonstrates good Python understanding, efficient use of Pandas with good syntax, and great matplotlib proficiency
- Great analysis and depth of exploration at station, weekly, and hourly level
- Good visualizations -- not too much info, clear and interpretable. Love the busiest stations highlighted in orange on gray, very effective way to highlight relevant info.

## Comments:

- Great job on project 1! :)
- Love the approach/project design of using school-area stations to target students
- Nice visualizations and analysis
- Be sure to include a "results" section in your README in the future -- just a quick high-level overview of your key takeaways!
